Fully working on Android, not enough time to refine for ios.

Spend a sum of 16 hours to finish it but not constantly.

Used all functional components, Typescript, no need for state management in this app but if we needed I would use redux.

## things I would do if I had more time:
  1. add a map box to Country detail page when you tap on it the full map would be shown on modal.
  2. add a wiki data modal for each country about their history and culture
  3. add cryptocurrency exchange section for each country and in general
  4. find my country with my location
  5. add an image pager slideshow for each country
  
  
at the end I did all this with LOVE and joy. Thank you so much for your time  :hearts:
